# trump-weather


Trump has a few dozen tweets about climate change. Given the weather outside trump tower, what is the likelyhood Trump will tweet about climate change? The hypothesis is that the colder the temp, the more likely Trump will tweet about climate change.

For example, from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/418542137899491328) and [this data](http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/zipcode/10022/2014-01-01).

> This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop. Our planet is freezing, record low temps,and our GW scientists are stuck in ice
